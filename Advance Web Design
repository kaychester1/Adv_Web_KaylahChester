Hello Professor Chu
This is my first repository on Github
I hope I am doing this correctly because I feel like I am not. I am still kind of confused as to how this is supposed to be presented, and I don't really know how to navigate this program. Is this supposed to be a re-do of our introduction page?

Hi my name is Kaylah Chester,
I Was born in Philadelphia, PA and I am a Junior here a Millersville Umiversity. I chose Millersville because I felt like this school gave me options when picking my career choice. I used to be a Fine arts major because I really wanted to be a traditional artist and study animation. I chose Graphic Design because in some way you could incorporate those skills by using different aspects of design. 

I personaly prefer to do Print and Branding design. I felt like I was able to be more personal with it and be open to be more creative plus I am not good at coding. I was never a fan of web design and I don't think anything will change my mind on it. It really does frustrates me and I struggle to learn this language because I can never find what wrong in my code. I don't mind doing the layous I just hate coding.
